# MYO Demo Application for iOS

Re-write of the original [Myo iOS app](https://developer.thalmic.com/downloads) that comes with the SDK in Swift.

# Changes

* Added Cocoapods for dependency managemnet.
* Removed usless comments - the philoshipy is to keep it short and let the code speak for itself.
* Add vibration on sync/unsync gesture - similar to the way the desktop Mac app works.
